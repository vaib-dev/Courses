# Repository
A Git repository contains the history of a collection of files starting from a certain directory. The process of copying an existing Git repository via the Git tooling is called cloning. After cloning a repository the user has the complete repository with its history on his local machine.
Here I will quickly describe - what is a repository and what are all the possible actions on it. 

For-ex:

1. Create
2. Remove
3. Clone
4. Fork

## Create
           Git also supports the creation of new repositories.Steps are:
          1. In the upper-right corner of any page, click , and then click New repository.
          2. In the Owner drop-down, select the account you wish to create the repository on.
          3. Type a name for your repository, and an optional description.
          4. Choose to make the repository either public or private. Public repositories are visible to the public, while private       repositories are only accessible to you, and people you share them with. For more information, see "Setting repository visibility."

## Clone
          3. If you clone a Git repository, by default, Git assumes that you want to work in this repository as a user. Git also supports the creation of repositories targeting the usage on a server.

# Clone

Now, what cloning basically does is that it makes a copy of the whole repository or the project files along with the 'git' files on your local machine, so that whenever you make changes to your file you can commit them locally in your PC and if you want then probably push it up to their server where you can see all .

When you create a new repository on GitHub, it exists as a remote 28 location where your project is stored. You can clone your repository to create a local copy on your computer so that you can sync between both the local and remote locations of the project.

Unlike forking, you won’t be able to pull down changes from the original repository you cloned from, and if the project is owned by someone else you won’t be able to contribute back to it unless you are specifically invited as a collaborator 15. Cloning is ideal for instances when you need a way to quickly get your own copy of a repository where you may not be contributing to the original project.

To clone a repository, head over to the main page of a project and click the Clone or download button to get the the repository’s HTTPS or SSH URL. Then, you can perform the clone using the git clone command in your command line interface of choice.

# Chapter 3 - Facilitation

The definition of facilitate is "to make easy" or "ease a process." Facilitation is the art of leading people through processes towards agreed-upon objectives in a manner that encourages participation, ownership and creativity by all those involved”

Facilitation can be driven by an external role that is dedicated to facilitation (a facilitator) or by the group members themselves.

## Who is a Facilitator?

A facilitator is an individual who uses self-awareness, self-management, group awareness, and group process to enable teams understand and achieve their objectives by promoting collaboration, optimizing the process and creating synergy within the team. In doing so, the facilitator remains "neutral", meaning he/she does not take a particular position in the discussion.

What a facilitator does is plan, guide and manage a group event to ensure that the group's objectives are met effectively, with clear thinking, good participation and full buy-in from everyone who is involved.

Unlike coaching, facilitation always involves a group of people, although the facilitated event can be used as an opportunity for the Scrum Master to coach the group to increase their effectiveness in collaborating together in generating collective intelligence. Here, a question might arrive Why do we need a facilitator, this we will see in the next section.

## Why do we need a Facilitator?

Maximizing collective intelligence comes at a cost because there will be many differences in the room. There will be people with different needs, that comes from different experience and background. There will be people with different views and thoughts that come from their different position and roles in the organization. Even though all voices must be heard but not all voice has the same scale of quality. A great SM is able to maximize collective intelligence from these differences and many voices. So we need facilitation because there are many voices and we want to maximize that into powerful collective intelligence. By default, the SM facilitates the Scrum events: Sprint Planning, Daily Scrum, Sprint Review and Sprint Retrospectives or even a Product Backlog refinement session.\

Facilitation matters. It is more than just sticky notes and dots for voting. It is a craft. Our reality is socially constructed, which means that how we talk to and with one another—the words we use, the way we speak, the metaphors that describe our ideas—all inform the effectiveness or ineffectiveness of our work. Teams do not typically have the ability or skill to talk with each other productively without practice. This is the promise of facilitation. \
Now that we have discussed the why and the what, let’s discuss the flow of facilitation.

## The how: the flow of a facilitated event

To facilitate an event well, you must first understand the group's desired outcome, and the background and context of the meeting or event.

1. **The input**: Effective facilitation requires knowing the input.

- We have to ensure no one in the room is hiding important information that may degrade the quality of the outcome of the facilitated event. This may be a Product Owner who is holding an information for her personal advantage. Or an architect who has been influenced by the CEO before the meeting begins.The challenge here as a SMis we need to uphold Scrum value of openness.
- In Scrum itself, there are boundaries such as timebox. Some Scrum Teams may craft their own prime directives. Prime directives are a shared agreement to ensure that no one is stepping on each other's toe during the facilitated event. If there aren’t any, it is a good idea for the SM to start creating prime directives and remind everyone before a facilitated event starts.
- Before the event start, we need to understand what is the goal of the facilitated event. Scrum Teams who start their Sprint Planning with a Sprint Goal may use this as the goal of the Sprint Planning.
- The last thing that we need to understand is to understand the context of the event. Is it for generating a solution? Or just to generate ideas and explore new possibilities? Is it for alignment or is it a conflict between individuals? Without understanding the context of the facilitated event, we as a SM can not facilitate the event effectively.

2. **The facilitated event itself**: After all of the inputs are known and placed on the table, the facilitated event happen. After this facilitated event, the group should come up with choices to be made. In this facilitated event the SM must:

   Keep everyone engaged. Being able to sense the room is very important for the SM to keep everyone engaged. Some questions the SM can ask when not everyone is fully engaged:

- Is the person who is not engaged should even be in the room? How can that person increase the quality of the discussion?
- Is there someone hi-jacking the whole event? Maybe the boss who tries to lead the team to think as he wants it to be?
- Is everyone's voice being heard? Are we undermining his/her voice because of his position or pay grade in the company?
- Did someone just change their behavior? Is everyone playing with their phones?\
  Keep everyone focused. Keeping everyone engaged is very important, but often times it is too easy for people being sidetracked too far away and forget the first reason for being there. Some questions that the SM should ask:

- Is this topic still related to the goal or objective of us being here?
- How is the timebox? Are we close the timebox already? Should we push the discussion forward?
- Have we got enough choices for the group to decide?

  Stay neutral and unbiased. The SM must stay neutral and unbiased throughout the facilitated event otherwise it will lower the quality of the decision that will be made by the group. The SM must not have any interest or preferences in the solution offered by the group of people. The SM must focus on the idea given by the person rather than his/her position in the organization. The SM must not pick sides, for example favoring the solution from the boss because he/she is in the room or not listening to someone's idea because he/she is on the lower pay grade.

3. **Free and Informed choices**: Free choices mean that each choice placed on the table are testable by logics from people outside of the group. The choices are neither self-serving or self-sealing certain individuals for their personal advantage. Informed choices mean that everyone understood that the choices are not generated under an influence or even a manipulation. Everyone understood that all choices are made with integrity given the situation. It is important for the SM to ensure that all of the choices are free and informed.

4. **The outcome**: The outcome of this facilitated event is a high-quality decision that is owned by everyone. What that means is everyone is holding eachother accountable for the decision made. This high-quality decision is transparent to everybody and tangible, which means the quality of the decision can be measured.

A SM should facilitate by creating a "container" for the team to fill up with their ideas and innovations. The container, often a set of agenda questions or some other lightweight (and flexible) structure, gives the team just enough of a frame to stay on their purpose and promotes and environment for richer interaction, a place where fantastic ideas can be heard. The coach creates the container; the team creates the content." Now let us see some of the traits of a high-quality facilitator in the next section.

## The who: high-quality facilitator

So far we’ve discussed the flow of facilitation and we’ve learned that poor quality facilitator is one of the reason the group of people came up with the poor quality decision. So what does a high-quality facilitator look like? Here are some qualities I found important to be an effective facilitator:

1. **Trustworthy**: That means SM act on integrity and is not easily swayed away by anyone. Let us look at an example here: Once Tim was been pushed to the wall by a middle-manager of his company once where he told Tim to hide an important information during a facilitated event because if that information is exposed during the event it may risk his position.Hiding this information will lower the quality of the decision made. In this case, if Tim just listened and manipulate the event as he wants it to be, He will lose trust of the team. It is very important for a Scrum Master as a facilitator to be professional and stand on code-of-ethics.
2. **Objective and neutral**: Not only the SM should be trustworthy, but they must also be neutral and unbiased. What that means is that they should not have any self-interest in the outcome of the facilitated event and has no preferences offered by the team.
3. **Has effective behavior**: As a facilitator, the SM should have effective behavior. That means the SM is an excellent communicator, fluid and creative throughout the facilitated event. Having effective behavior means that they do not bring their emotion to the facilitated event nor invite everyone to bring their emotions because emotions make the quality discussion looks fuzzy.
4. **Ability to increase group effectiveness collaborating together**:A great SM is not only facilitating the event to come up with a high-quality decision but at the same time, they also are able to increase team's effectiveness collaborating together during the facilitated events.\
   This requires knowledge in group dynamics, knowing when something is outside of the group’s norm. For ex, when somebody in the room starts becoming silence after a word is being mentioned, what does that mean? Understanding group dynamics also mean at the same time the Scrum Master needs to be dynamic during the event and courageous to cancel her original plan for the event when something changes during the event. To be dynamic, the Scrum Master needs to have many facilitation tools under her belt!
5. **Ability to create a mutual learning environment**: A good SM is able to make every facilitated event as a mutual learning opportunity, whether that is a Sprint Planning, Sprint Review, the Daily Scrum or even the non-built-in Scrum events. Every facilitated event is an opportunity for everyone to learn from each other.\
   Many SM are only seen as the team’s babysitter or ceremony organizer because they do not know how to use every facilitated event as a mutual learning opportunity. And that is also a reason why many organizations view the Scrum Master becoming less valuable in the long run because they're not getting value from the SM.

These qualities will distinguish a great SM from a Scrum Master as an event organizer or SM as the master of ceremonies.

## The Art and Science of Facilitation

Facilitation is both an art and a science. The science comes from what we know about how people think, how groups behave and teams develop.The art is how the facilitator learns to dance in the moment: seeing what’s happening in a group, hearing what’s behind the way the group talks with one another, listening for what’s not being said, and letting the magic of the group’s collective intelligence organically emerge.

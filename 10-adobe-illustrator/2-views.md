pp# Chapter - 3 Views
By default, Adobe Illustrator sets the view so that all artwork is previewed in color. However, you can choose to display artwork so that only its outlines (or paths) are visible. To view all artwork as outlines, choose View > Outline or press Ctrl+E (Windows) or Command+E (macOS).

## Types Of Views
There are three viewing modes in Illustrator: 
1. Preview
2. Artwork
3. Preview Selection

We will study about them one by one:
### 1. Preview Mode
Preview option is nothing but the view that you see on the screen is known as preview mode. There are further three types of preview mode available in illustrator which are as discussed below:

**1. Outline**: This mode is used to view the all editing without any color and strokes. In outline view the grey are on our screen also becomes white. You can enable the outline mode by clicking on View->Outline.

**2. GPU**: A new GPU Performance feature in the latest update to Illustrator CC speeds up the entire canvas by over 10x, letting artists pan and zoom seamlessly in real time, regardless of image size, feature mix or display resolution. To turn on GPU mode click on View->GPU Preview. 

**3. Trim**: This option enable you to hide all the other editing outside the artboard like if you have a shape outside the white area then when you enable the trim area you will not be able to see that shape.

### 2. Artwork
By default, Adobe Illustrator sets the view so that all artwork is previewed in color. However, you can choose to display artwork so that only its outlines (or paths) are visible. Viewing artwork without paint attributes speeds up the time it takes to redraw the screen when working with complex artwork.

In Outline mode, linked files are displayed by default as outlined boxes with an X inside. To view the contents of linked files, choose File > Document Setup, and select Show Images In Outline Mode.

### 3. Preview Selection 
This mode shows us which part of the image or thing on the artboard is selected. When we click on ony item on the artboard or select any area that thing undergoes the preview mode.

## Custom Views
First, use the Hand and Zoom tools to adjust your Illustrator document to your desired view. Custom views also works with layer visibility, so toggle the visibility of your layers to you liking. Next, chose View > New View and assign a name to the new view. You can repeat this as many times as needed. After the new view is created, the view will appear at the bottom of the View menu, allowing you to quickly jump to a custom view.

The custom views are saved with the document, so they will be available even after you’ve save and reopen the document.

Below is an example of using custom views in a series of icons I sell on istock. I create all the icons on multiple artboards in one Illustrator document. Continually zooming and adjusting the view from artboard to artboard gets cumbersome, so I use custom views to quickly jump to common views, hiding layers, and a overall view of the icons:

## Summary

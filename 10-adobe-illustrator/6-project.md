Implementing the knowledge that we gained from the above chapters, I have created my first project as a penguin image as shown below:

# Chapter - 6 Creating A Project
So, finally we have reached the most exciting chapter i.e making a project in illustrator. In this chapter we are given some information on the basis of which we have to design our logo. 
## About The Project
Let's say we are a company - who came to life in the time of Corona. We are a team of only females and we are starting very small. Our company is channelizing the mask production. You might have seen that a lot of ladies are using old and used clothes at their home to make masks and they can also make more if needed. Our company is bringing these extra masks created by them to the market - we only keep a small profit share in between and hand over most of it to the right creator.

## Idea Behind Making Logo
When I read about the project information than I noted down some keywords on a paper that were recycle, cloth, mask(don't worry this may very in your case). So then I started searching on recycle topic then I found the logo of recycling products that we all are aware of. So then I started building the recycle logo once I build that then I thought were I have to put this logo. Then, again searching on google goes on scrolling up and down. Then I finally found a [picture](https://image.shutterstock.com/z/stock-vector-recycling-clothes-hand-over-your-old-clothes-for-recycling-clothing-falls-into-a-container-with-a-1404382760.jpg) that suited my idea. 

So then I started working on it and the final product that came out is as shown:

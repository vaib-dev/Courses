 Step2: Select All four Circles and use the Shape Builder Tool from the Toolbox. As soon as we select the Shape Builder Tool, we create a path to be built.

 ## Compound Paths 

Compound paths let you use an object to cut a hole in another object. For example, you can create a doughnut shape from two nested circles. Once you create a compound path, the paths act as grouped objects. You can select and manipulate the objects separately using the Direct Selection tool or Group Selection tool; or you can select and edit the combined path.

## Group Paths 
Keep objects together by grouping them in Adobe Illustrator CC. The Group function is handy when you’re creating something from multiple objects, such as a logo. Using the Group function, you can ensure that all objects that make up the logo stay together when you move, rotate, scale, or copy it.

To group the items together select the black arrow from the left panel of the screen. Then just select the items you want to group by clicking the left button of the mouse and dragging it. After selecting press Ctr+G to group the items. Now if you try to move any item then all the items will move in one go.

In future, if you wish to ungroup then just select the black arrow again and click the left mouse and drag it on the items you have selected then just press Ctrl+Shift+G and the items will we ungrouped. 

## Summary

So here we learned some important editing features that illustrator provides. These features are shape builder tool, compound paths, grouped paths.

Now we have learned all the main functions or features of the illustrator which helps in making our work easy. So the time has come to start with our first project. 

In the next chapter, we will start with creating our first project.

# Chapter - 2 Customizing
One way of getting comfortable is setting Illustrator's preferences. In this chapter we learn about:
* Art-board
* Paths 
* Options


## Art-boards

An Artboard in Illustrator works like a physical piece of paper on a desk. Similar to pages in Indesign CC, artboards can be different sizes and orientations and be arranged however suits your workflow. 

### 1. Add an artboard

Select the Artboard tool in the Toolbar, and drag on the canvas to create an artboard. You can resize it by dragging a corner handle with the Artboard tool.

To duplicate an existing artboard, select an artboard with the Artboard tool. Then press Option (MacOS) or Alt (Windows) and drag an exact copy of the artboard and its contents. You can do this to create color or design variations side-by-side.

### 2. Draw an artboard to size
As you drag to resize your artboard, look for the small tool tip that shows the dimensions.\
Once created, you can select an artboard preset from the Artboards section of the Properties panel to resize an artboard automatically.

### 3. Organize your artboards
It’s easy to end up with many artboards scattered around your canvas. To rearrange them, simply drag artboards with the Artboard tool.\
You can name your artboards to help you to keep track of the contents. Select an artboard and type a name in the Artboards section of the Properties panel.

## Paths
A path is the black line that appears when you draw a line in Adobe Illustrator. A path is made up of a series of points called “anchor points” and line segments between these points. The anchor points on either end of a path have “control handles” and these can be used to control the direction of the curved path.
In Adobe Illustrator, when creating logo designs, you can use either pencil, paintbrush or the pen tools to draw paths and then use the anchor points and controls handles. 

With the pen tool, we will draw an arc. You can draw this arc by placing a point on the artboard and the pulling the control handle a little to the bottom left and then drawing a second point and dragging the control handle of that point to form a smooth arc. Using the same method we will draw 10 arcs and then connect them to form the shape.

## Smart Guides
Smart Guides are on by default. To turn Smart Guides on or off, choose View > Smart Guides or press Ctr+U. Use Smart Guides in the following ways: When you create an object with the pen or shape tools, use the Smart Guides to position a new object's anchor points relative to an existing object. It makes your work easy by telling you the length of the line matches with length of the other line or not. But some times it becomes a headache, so you also have option to turn it off. Go to view-> Smart Guides, uncheck it.

## Summary
So at the end of the day we came to know about the artboard and how much it is important to understand, then we studied about paths which will be helping us a lot in designing logos and shapes, after this we moved on to smart guides and saw how we can use them for our benefit.

In the next chapter we will start with types of paletts in illustrator.

# Chapter - 1 Introduction
Adobe Illustrator is a vector graphics editor and design program developed and marketed by Adobe Inc. Originally designed for the Apple Macintosh, development of Adobe Illustrator began in 1985. Along with Creative Cloud, Illustrator CC was released.
## Interface
When you first open Adobe Illustrator, you’ll come to a welcome screen. This screen has several useful things for you: easy access to recent documents, templates for projects, and quick links to open or create a new document.

Here’s my interface when I first open Illustrator. Again, it’ll look different from yours, but don’t worry too much about that right now.

## Panels
On the right side of your screen are the panels. Panels extend functionality and add options to your workflow. If you want to see a list of all the panels, go into the Window menu (menu at the very top of the program). Again, in future tutorials, you’ll get experience with these panels. For now, I’ll just introduce you to the four most often used panels:
1. **Color panel**: change the color of objects
2. **Text panels**: Character & Paragraph
3. **Pathfinder panel**: Alter objects, such as combining or subtracting
4. **Align panel**: Align objects to each other or the artboard
## Tools box
Lets see what functions are available on your toolbox:
### 1. Selection Tools:
 Used most often, the selection tools are used to tell Illustrator which objects you are working on. The selection tools are:
1. **The Selection tool**: Used to select and move objects
1. **The Direct Selection tool**: Used to select parts of an object
1. **The Group Selection tool**: A variation of the Direct Selection tool, used to select grouped
items
### 2. Creation Tools
The creation tools allow you to create your artwork, each tool serving a specific drawing task.
The creation tools are
1.  **The Pen tool**: Used to create B*zier paths
1. **The Add Anchor Point tool**: Adds an anchor point to an existing path
1. **The Delete Anchor Point tool**: Removes an existing anchor point
1. **The Convert Direction Point tool**: Changes a selected anchor point of one type into another
1. **The Pencil tool**: Used to draw freehand single path lines
1. **The Paintbrush tool**: Used to create filled variable-width objects
### 3. Transformation Tools
Power is being able to change that which you have. Illustrator's transformation tools give you the
power you need to perfect your art. The transformation tools are:
1. **The Rotate tool**: Used to rotate selected objects
1. **The Twirl tool**: Used to distort selected objects in a circular fashion
1. **The Scale tool**: Used to resize selected objects
1. **The Reshape tool**: Used to make simple changes in the shape of a Big sizer segment
1. **The Reflect tool**: Used to mirror selected objects
1. **The Shear tool**: Used to skew or slant selected objects
### 4. Assorted Tools
Some tools just can't be categorized. Illustrator contains a wealth of task-specific tools to assist
you in your quest for the perfect art. Illustrator's remaining tools are:
1. **The Autotrace tool**: Traces bitmapped art and converts it to vector
1. **The Graph tool**: Creates an assortment of different graphs
1. **The Measure tool**: Used to measure distance and angles.
1. **The Gradient tool**: Used to control the way gradients are filled within an object
1. **The Paint Bucket tool**: Used to copy fill and stroke attributes from one object to another

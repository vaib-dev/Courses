# Chapter - 3 Paletts 
Generally, palettes refers to a thin board or tablet of wood, plastic, etc., often with a hole for the thumb at one end, on which an artist arranges and mixes paints. The colors used by a particular artist or for a particular painting. In illustrator palettes can be divided into different types as follows:
##  1. Info palette 
Info palettes tell you about the various things about your picture. Info palette is present at the rightmost side of your illustrator screen. It is mainly divided into three sub-categories as follows:

### Properties
The property section allows you to edit the document size, units, and to add rulers & grids to your document. Mainly we use the units option as from there we can select the type of units we wanna work with like inches, centimeters, pixels etc. 
### Layers 
Here we can add or remove the layers. The Layer option plays a very crucial role while editing in illustrator due to layers option we can work on different layers at a single time. Layer option provides us different modes like lock the layer, hide the content of the layer, adjust the layers.
### Libraries
We don't often use this feature. This feature allows us to add a new library into the illustrator. To open the Creative Cloud Library panel (Libraries panel), click Window > Libraries. Use the Libraries panel to: Create, view, rename, remove, and use a Creative Cloud Library.
## 2. Transform palette
This option is present inside the object option which you can see in the below picture. The transform palette have the following options as follows:

### Move
This option is used to move the selected area if you are working on a very detailed feature. This feature allows you to adjust the selected area by horizontal, vertical, how much distance you want to move your area, at what angle you want to set it, etc.

### Rotate
As it is clear from the name that rotate is used to rotate the selected area. You can rotate the area by specifying the angle in degrees. You can also enable the preview option if you want to see the change that is going to happen after clicking OK button. The copy option allows you to create a copy of the original area but with the angle you select.

### Scale
Scaling an object enlarges or reduces it horizontally (along the x axis), vertically (along the y axis), or both. Objects scale relative to a reference point which varies depending on the scaling method you choose. You can change the default reference point for most scaling methods, and you can also lock the proportions of an object.

### Shear
Shearing an object slants, or skews, the object along the horizontal or vertical axis, or a specified angle thatâ€™s relative to a specified axis. Objects shear relative to a reference point which varies depending on the shearing method you choose and can be changed for most shearing methods. You can lock one dimension of an object as you shear it, and you can shear one object or multiple objects simultaneously.

## 4. Color palette
Adobe Illustrator refers to color palettes as swatches. Color swatches are groups of preset colors. Users can select colors from the generic swatch preset or load any number of custom swatch sets. You can also add new colors to any color swatch set.
## 5. Gradient palette 
This option is present at the left panel of your screen using these you can add gradient effect in your editing.
## 6. Stroke palette
This option allows you to adjust the size and color of the border of the area you select. It has many extra features like if you want to curve the edges of the straight line then you can use the caps option present in it.

In the next chapter we will see different views in illustrator.

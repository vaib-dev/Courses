# Chapter 3 - Agile Methods

Agile is one form of software development methodology. Its main focus is on client satisfaction through continuous delivery. The focus of Agile is more on limiting the project scope. An agile project sets a minimum number of requirements and turns them into a deliverable product.

## What is Agile ?
<img src ="https://149349666.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Agile-Manifesto-edited.png" height="350" width="600">


Agile software development refers to a group of software development methodologies based on iterative development, where requirements and solutions evolve through collaboration between self-organizing cross-functional teams. So by above picture and the defintion we found the main values as stated :

1) individuals and interactions **over** processes and tools
2) working software **over** comprehensive documentation
3) customer collaboration **over** contract negotiation
4) responding to change **over** following a plan
5) facts and data **over** intuition and feelings

## Why Agile ?

The agile method is based on giving high priority to customer participation, from the very beginning of the development cycle. The objective is to keep the client involved at every step so that they have a product that they are happy with at the end. This method saves the client money and time because the client tests and approves the product at each step of development. If there are defects or challenges, then changes can be made during production cycles to fix the issue. Traditional models of project management would not find defects as early because they do not test as often. 

## VUCA World

VUCA is an acronym (artificial word), first used in 1987 and based on the leadership theories of Warren Bennis and Burt Nanus, and stands for **Volatility, Uncertainty, Complexity and Ambiguity**.

<img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/7680/1*1QZubhe_T3c4mTiCZvJ2ZA.jpeg" width="600" height="300">

1. **Volatility** - The challange may be unexpected or unstable or may be of unknown duration but it's not necessarily hard to understand , knowledge about it is often available.

2. **Uncertainity** - Despite a lack of other information the event's basic cause and effect are known. Change possible but not a given.
3. **Complexity** - The situation has many interconnected parts and variables ,some information is available or can be predicted but the volume or nature of it can be overwhelming to process.
4. **Ambiguity** - Lack of clarity about how to interpret something. A situation is ambiguous, for example, when information is incomplete, contradicting or too inaccurate to draw clear conclusions. The more ambiguous the world is, the harder it is to interpret.

## Advantages of Agile
<img src="https://www.mindcypress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Benefits-of-Agile-training-and-best-courses-1024x521.png" height="300" width="600">

 1) **Transparency** - An Agile approach provides a unique opportunity for clients to be involved throughout the project, from prioritizing features to iteration planning and review sessions to frequent software builds containing new features.

 2) **Early and Predictable Delivery** - By using time-boxed, fixed schedule Sprints of 1-4 weeks, new features are delivered quickly and frequently, with a high level of predictability. This also provides the opportunity to release or beta test the software earlier than planned if there is sufficient business value.
3) **Predictable Costs and Schedule** - Because each Sprint is a fixed duration, the cost is predictable and limited to the amount of work that can be performed by the team in the fixed-schedule time box. Combined with the estimates provided to the client prior to each Sprint, the client can more readily understand the approximate cost of each feature, which improves decision making about the priority of features and the need for additional iterations.

4) **Allows for Change** - While the team needs to stay focused on delivering an agreed-to subset of the product’s features during each iteration, there is an opportunity to constantly refine and reprioritize the overall product backlog

## **Phases of Agile Methodology**
<img src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/56f09b0d7da24f87fc9e0589/1562322120903-VWETDNKOSAXJ0S6VK36D/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kGDpvalPb1SqHoCn1hwN0Y57gQa3H78H3Y0txjaiv_0fDoOvxcdMmMKkDsyUqMSsMWxHk725yiiHCCLfrh8O1z5QHyNOqBUUEtDDsRWrJLTmQPoRzxSr1hzN-vPBHt7YyLLXgctAyUJRqJUUGWVDK_ZzIgvsybGcZEPqUYiXY8im/duplicate+work+in+agile?format=750w" height="400" width="500">

1. **Requirements** - Before a Product Owner can even start designing a project, they need to create the initial documentation that will list the initial requirements. We gather the information like the product we gonna get at the end of the project , the features that will be available on it andd the features which will be added later on. All such information is gathered in this phase. Then we move to the next face which is designing.

2. **Design** - There are two ways to approach design in the software development — one is the visual design and the other is the architectural structure of the app. During the *first iteration*, the Product Owner assembles their development team and introduces the requirements created during the previous stage. The team then discusses how to tackle these requirements, and proposes the tools needed to achieve the best result. Then next phase comes which is known ass coding or development phase. 

3. **Development and Coding** - The development phase is about writing code and converting design documentation into the actual software within the software development process. This stage of SDLC is generally the longest as it’s the backbone of the whole process.There aren’t many changes between the iterations here.Then comes testing the software. 

4. **Testing** - This stage is spent on making sure that the software is bug-free and compatible with everything else that the developers have written before. The Quality Assurance team conducts a series of tests in order to ensure the code is clean and business goals of the solution are met. When the software passes the tests then we head up to the deployment phase. 
5. **Implementation and Deployment** - The
 application is deployed on the servers and 
 provided to the customers — either for the demo 
 or the actual use. Further iterations update the 
 already installed software, introducing new 
 features and resolving bugs. Then comes the final phase i.e reviewing the software.

 6. **Review** - Once all previous development 
 phases are complete, the Product Owner gathers 
 the Development Team once again and reviews the 
 progress made towards completing the 
 requirements. The team introduces their ideas 
 toward resolving the problems that arose during the previous phases and the Product Owner takes 
 their propositions into consideration. 
 After gathering all aspects  lifecycle phases start anew — either with anew iteration or by moving toward the next stage.


## Leight Weight Agile Frameworks
Each Agile framework is considered lightweight. Rules and practices are kept to a minimum, especially when compared to traditional waterfall-style development processes, and are designed to be adaptable to all kinds of circumstances. The focus, instead, falls on empowering developers of all kinds to collaborate and make decisions together as a group quickly and effectively. The grand vision behind the Agile development methodology is to create applications in small increments, with each individual increment tested before it is considered complete. This process assures quality is “built” into the product, versus inspecting for quality later. So we we will study one by one about different Leight Weight Agile Frameworks.

### 1. Kanban 
Kanban method revolves around the kanban board. It is a tool that visualizes the entire project to track the flow of their project. Through this graphical approach of Kanban boards, a new member or an external entity can understand what’s happening right now, tasks completed and future tasks.Kanban board indicates :

1. the current tasks that are being performed
2. the tasks to do in the future
3. the tasks that are completed

<img src="https://kissflow.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Kanban-project-management-framework-100.jpg" height="350" width="600">

**Workflow**

1. **Define your first and last step** -
To give the process a shape we start by outlining the first and the last step of the workflow. The first step is represented by the “requested” state and the last by the “done” state. In this we don't use the term “almost done” trap.
2. **Outline the steps in-between** -
Make a list of all the steps you go through after you have started to work on a given item and before finishing it. Keep in mind that this is not the final version of your board and you will edit it many times as your experience and process evolve.
3. **Determine the level of details** -
It is important to determine how deep into the details your process will go. Too complex flows could harm your productivity and create confusion in your team.

4. **Determine the shape of your process** - The columns of the Kanban board represent the horizontal (linear) process of your flow. The swim-lanes on the other side represent the vertical aspects of it.

<img src="https://www.integrify.com/site/assets/files/2473/kanban-project-management.png" height="300" width="500">

5. **Continuous improvement** - Kanban is an continuous journey without an end.Every process can be improved further, there is not an exception to this rule. So don’t forget to improve your work process regularly if there is a need for it.

### 2. Scrum  
A PM(project management) methodology where a small team is led by a Scrum Master whose main job is to clear away all obstacles to completing work. Work is done in short cycles called sprints, but the team meets daily to discuss current tasks and roadblocks that need clearing.

**Roles in  Scrum Framework**
Scrum framework consists of three roles and these roles together form the scrum team. 

<img src="https://images.mendix.com/wp-content/uploads/scrum-team-illustration.svg" height="300" width="800">

1) **Product Owner** : The product owner represents all the possible stakeholders and the customer in each case. It has the responsibility of delivering the maximum possible value to the customer. The product owner does not get the things done rather he prioritizes things on the demands and importance. A scrum team should have only one product owner.

2) **Scrum Master** : Scrum Master is responsible for facilitating a scrum, ensure that there are no hassles on the way of quality product or deliverable being delivered. The scrum master ensures that the Scrum framework is followed. The scrum master encourages the team to improve. The role has also been referred to as a team facilitator or servant-leader to reflect the dual aspects. 

3) **Development Team**: The development team is responsible for delivering optimum quality work with each passing sprint. The sprint goal describes the work a team should do and the quality it must deliver at the end of each sprint. A team has  three to nine members who carry out all tasks required to build the product increments. It is a self-organizing team and interactions outside the team is managed by the product owner or the scrum master.

**Workflow**
<img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1024/0*YdGp-9USV9C5Skuh" height="350" width="700">

1) **Sprint** : A sprint/iteration is the unit of a Scrum. A sprint is limited to a specific time. The duration of a sprint is decided beforehand and is normally, between one week to one month, commonly two weeks.

2) **Sprint Planning** : Initially, the scrum team conducts sprint planning. Mutually decide the scope of work that should be done during a sprint. Identify items that can be done in just one sprint. The expected time taken is four hours per day for two weeks.If at the end of sprint team finds that some work is incomplete it is kept in the product baclog. When the sprint backlog is developed by the development team, the items which can be completed within a sprint are taken up.

3) **Daily Sprint** : A daily scrum or stand up is held every day with each sprint.Time is limited to fifteen minutes. Each team member is expected to answer three questions during the daily scrum questions be like : What do I need to do today to help my team contribute to my team’s sprint goal today?

4) **Sprint Review** : It is held at the end of the sprint in this the team reviews the completed work and the work that is yet to be completed. The completed work is submitted to the stakeholders.

5) **Sprint Retrospective** : At the sprint retrospective, the team studies the past sprint.Identifies the flaws and rectifies them.

6) **Extensions** : Extension includes two events namely: Backlog refinement & Cancellation of a sprint.

### 3. Extreme Prpgramming (XP)  
In XP methodology  you can change the project 
 plan, budget, and even the final deliverable to 
 fit changing needs, no matter how far along the 
 project is.

 **Workflow** 
<img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.trenovision.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/eXtreme-Programming-XP.png?resize=730%2C531&ssl=1" height="250" width="600">

 1) **Planning** - This is the first phase of the Extreme Programming life cycle, which involves user stories along with iterations. The user stories are collected from the client requirements by the development team. The developers will work on iterations once after the development team concocts the scheme, time, and money of functioning the iterations.
2) **Designing** - The team should strive for simplicity, use system metaphors to describe the implementation and CRC cards for design sessions. They create spike solutions to reduce risk and don’t add functionality early. 

3) **Coding** - Coding is the most vital phase of XP as it has max. priority over all other tasks. In XP coding is done by pair programming method in which the pair work together on one code in order to improve quality and get less errors.
4) **Testing** - In Extreme Programming, testing always comes with coding and development stage rather than after the completion. Occasionally, there are developers and teams where they write the tests first and write the codes later because that will give them some idea of what their codes need to do. They are also called Unit Tests and the purpose of doing them is to remove bugs before the delivery.

5) **Listening** -
In every phrase in this cycle listening to the client is very important to see what they expect the system to do because with listening to the clients, developers ensure they understand these requirements.
### 4. LeSS
  Most of the scaling elements of LeSS are focused on directing the attention of all of the teams onto the whole product instead of “my part.” Global and “end-to-end” focus are perhaps the dominant problems to solve in scaling.

**Workflow** 
 <img src="https://less.works/img/framework/why-less-framework.png" height="" width="700">

 1) **Sprint Planning Part 1**: In addition to the one Product Owner, it includes people from all teams. Let team members self-manage to decide their division of Product Backlog Items.
2) **Sprint Planning Part 2** : This is held independently (and usually in parallel) by each Team, though sometimes for simple coordination and learning two or more Teams may hold it in the same room (in different areas).
3) **Daily Scrum** : This is also held independently by each Team, though a member of Team A may observe Team B’s Daily Scrum, to increase information sharing.

4) **Overall PBR** : The key purpose is to decide which teams are likely to implement which items and therefore select those items for later in-depth single-team PBR. 
5) **Product Backlog Refinement** :  In LESs a common and useful variation is multi-team PBR, where two or more Teams are in the same room together, to increase learning and coordination.
6) **Sprint Review** : In addition to the one Product Owner, it includes people from all teams, and relevant customers/users and other stakeholders. 
7) **Overall Retrospective** : Its purpose is to explore improving the overall system, rather than focusing on one Team. The maximum duration is 45 minutes per week of Sprint. It includes the Product Owner, Scrum Masters, and rotating representatives from each Team.

## Scaled Agile Frameworks 

Software development teams have proven that implementing agile frameworks, like scrum and kanban, lets them deliver solutions to customers faster, with more predictability, and gives them the ability to react quickly based on new information. Implementing agile at the individual team level is relatively easy - the benefits are clear and the resources are plenty.

But the real challenge is extending it across multiple teams in a large organization. In other words, implementing agile at scale. Now we discuss breiefly about methods to apply agile at large scale.

### 1. LeSS HUGE
<img src="https://less.works/img/less-huge/less-huge-framework.png" height="" width="1500">

In LeSS Huge, there are multiple Basic LeSS implemented at the same time. It is meant for large organizations where there are more than eight teams. There are Area Product Owners(APO) who are responsible for their respective product backlog. Upto three teams work under an APO. A chief product owner(CPO) leads the APO and focuses on the entire product. So the question arises why we need a APO so the main reason for having APO is to prevent the Product Owner from becoming overloaded. Without an APO, the Product Owner overload would be because :

1) **The PB becoming too large** - Lean thinking promotes small batches and short cycles. We suggest that each team have at least four PBIs for each iteration that they can complete independently within that iteration. With 50 teams this leads to a PB with 200 PBIs just for one iteration. Prioritizing 200 PBIs per iteration is too much work for one PO.

2) **Teams working on the whole system** — Feature teams are good, and so is learning new parts of the system. But too much learning without delivering value is not good. This can happen when teams work on completely unfamiliar features. They have no opportunity to specialize and this affects teams’ velocity. 

So, to remove such possibilities we need an APO in order to reduce the tension of PO. Else all the methodology is same as LeSS small scale framework.


### 2. SAFe

SAFe came in use in 2011, it promotes alignment, collaboration, and delivery across large numbers of agile teams. It was formed around three primary bodies of knowledge: agile software development, lean product development, and systems thinking.

It has two to four levels:
* Team level
* Program level
* Large solution level (optional)
* Portfolio level (optional)

<img src="https://www.scaledagileframework.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Scaled-Agile-Framework-_Portfolio_web.png" height="" width="1000">

1) **Team level** - At the team level (called Agile team) SAFe says to work just like Scrum, however teams can also work in Kanban. Teams work together to deliver working software every two weeks. The Product Owner is responsible for the Team Backlog.  Then there’s Built-In Quality. Built-In Quality are practices that should be followed for every increment. This resembles the Definition of Done from Scrum, although the latter is determined by the Development Team. 
2) **Program Level** - Here we are talking about multiple teams working to deliver something together. This can be scaled to up to 150 people. The teams work to create a Program Increment, to be delivered after 5 Sprints (10 weeks).

   The teams and stakeholders together are called the **Agile Release Train(AGT)**. AGT are aligned to a common business or technology mission. They plan, develop and deploy together.

   The content for each Release Train i.e a Potentially Shippable Increment, is determined by a **Product Manager** by means of a Program Backlog. This Program Backlog has most of the items that fill the Team Backlogs. The **Release Train Engineer** is the train Scrum Master, equivalent to a Program Manager (according to SAFe). Scrum Masters and the Release Train Engineer have bi-weekly meetings  to have the whole train sprinting together and that teams are not working ahead or lagging.

   At this level there are four Sprints to deliver the Potentially Shippable Increment. The fifth Sprint is for *hardening, innovation and planning*. Hardening is for a final verification and for testing. Innovation is about exploring new ideas. Planning entails the demo on program level, maintenance on the train and the planning for the next cycle of 10 weeks.

3) **Large Solution Level** - This level is intended to manage large solutions that can’t be handled by a single program (Agile Release Train). The larger solution is coordinated by a Solution Train, consisting of a Solution Manager, Solution Architect and a Solution Train Engineer. They align and coordinate multiple Agile Release Trains.
4) **Portfolio Level** - Portfolio Management dictates the direction of the trains by allocating the budget. At this level a Backlog of Portfolio level Epics which will trickle down to the trains Product Managers. Kanban is used at this level to limit the overhead.
